Okay, so I see a man standing among, in a cemetery. He seems to be in prayer because is hands are clasped, clasped together. And he’s possibly paying his respects to whoever was, whoever’s grave he's standing in front of, but… Well, I like, I like that the colours, actually, it's quite, it's monochrome, but it's interesting cos all the shading as such that, it's done very well, as such that it looks like a 3D photo, and it can copy depth very well. Based on size of the images and the overlay of the man above a lot of other small tombstones, I'm just gonna call them tombstones, I think they're tombstones. And, yeah, even trough it's kind of
