Ehm, I see a man lying in his back, and he’s, he’s sort of resting on another person. I don’t know whether he is sleeping or whether he’s death, I can’t quite make it out. Ehm, I like the contrast of colour, black and white. Ehm, very very striking, very vivid. Ehm, i-it looks kind of disturbing, in a way, because you can’t quite make out if these people are dead or alive, you can’t quite tell. Ehm, sort of it could be, sort of erotic in a way because you don’t know  whether they are up to no good or they are death , you can’t quite tell. I can see a person looking away from the camera perspective, I don’t know what they’re doing.
